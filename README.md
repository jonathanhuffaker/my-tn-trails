# my-tn-trails

This is my capstone project for Nashville Software School's Evening Cohort 2- Front End Class.  I wanted to choose a project that I would enjoy working on, but also one in which I truly believed that I would use.

MyTN Trail is a hiking app that allows you to share and rate your favorite hikes, connect with friends to discover new hikes, and share photos of you myHike Gallery.  While this is only Version 1 of myTN Trail, I plan to continue working on the app to incorporate additional features that users can come to enjoy. 

For this project I used Firebase, Bootstrap, and Angular.  If you would like to take a look setup is easy and have included instructions below.

``cd lib``

``bower install``

``npm install``

``cd ..``

``http-server``
